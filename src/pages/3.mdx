# Web controls explained

To keep things simpler, I'll be using one page for a while. While having lots of pages and links on a screen may be nice visually, there is an entirely different experience for people who use screen readers.

  That is the most important takeaway that you can come away with today: <br />

    incredibly wide number of people.

As a company, we have a legal responsibility to make sure that someone's disability doesn't prevent them from being able to use our website.

More than that, Accessibility is a way that we can respect the dignity of our users, by extending everyone the same opportunities to learn about and shop for our products as everyone else.

During this presentation, I'm drawing attention to the ways that people with limited sight and or mobility may interact with a website, using keyboard controls and a screen reader to interact with a website.

Most of us probably rely heavily on a mouse, when we are using a desktop computer. Other than that, we're used to simply tapping on our phone screen to interact with the part of the page that we want to control.

However, you're probably realizing right now that that approach doesn't work as well if you can't see precisely what your mouse is hovering over, or any of the content on your screen.

Fortunately, the people responsible for building our devices and web browsers had A11Y in mind when they designed the web. 

Behind the scenes, all webpages are broken down into chunks that various tools can work with to make content available to a user. With minimal attention to these users, we can make the exact same functionality available to everyone.

## Keyboard controls

Some of these chunks, referred to as "Elements" or "Tags", have specific logic about how they can be used by a keyboard, or assistive modes on a phone.

These options include:
<ul>
    <li>Links (the <code>{`<a>`}</code> tag)</li>
    <li>Buttons (the <code>{`<button>`}</code> tag)</li>
    <li>Forms</li>
    <li>Form Inputs</li>
</ul>

Let's look at a simple form:

<ExampleForm />

Thanks to the special functionality of a web browser, I can understand what is happening as I work through the page.
