# Interactive Accesibility

### or A11Y, for short

The Department of Justice (DOJ) published the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Standards for Accessible Design in September 2010. These standards state that all electronic and information technology must be accessible to people with disabilities.

<StaticQuery
  query={graphql`
    query {
      placeholderImage: file(relativePath: { eq: "A11Y-3.png" }) {
        childImageSharp {
          fluid(maxWidth: 300) {
            ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `}
  render={data => (
    <Img
      fluid={data.placeholderImage.childImageSharp.fluid}
      style={{ minWidth: "40vw", minHeight: "30vw" }}
      alt="Graphic explaining how the A11Y acronym was created"
    />
  )}

As you can see, this presentation is actually a website, and it is usable without requiring a mouse, or even the ability to see what is happening on the page visually.
