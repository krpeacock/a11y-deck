# Other Areas for Accessibility (thanks to a11yproject.com)

The full list of requirements that we follow are documented in the W.C.A.G. 2.1 guidelines, listed <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">here</a>.

Broadly speaking, there are four categories that we consider when we are designing accessible webpages.

## Visual

This can be non-sighted users, users with low-vision, users with obstructed vision, or even simply your aging parents.

Related Conditions

- Myopia (nearsightedness)
- Color Blindness
- Glaucoma
- Albinism

Beyond users who have zero ability to see, there are a wide variety of users who have some restriction in seeing. They may still use the website normally, but fonts with poor contrast against the background can be too hard to read.

Some users may need to increase the size of fonts significantly, or to zoom in for an easier time using a site. If our layout doesn't allow the font size to increase without breaking, we may be accidentally excluding those users by breaking their personal workflow.

## Auditory

The web is mostly useful for users with auditory challenges, but there are some areas that we still need to be mindful of. Captions for videos, and redundant text information for media that requires sound are mandatory for hearing-impaired users.

- Presbycusis
- Acoustic trauma
- Auditory processing disorder
- Otosclerosis

## Motor

People with motor impairments typically use a wide range of assistive technology from specialized keyboards, to eye trackers, to using single buttons (a device known as a “switch”) to navigate their computers.

Associated Conditions

- RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury)
- Cerebral Palsy
- Parkinson's
- Muscular Dystrophy

## Cognitive

- Down’s syndrome
- Autism
- Global developmental delay
- Dyslexia

## Temporary

While each of these disabilities is usually permanent, there are often situations in which even fully-abled people are “temporarily disabled”. For instance, an arm or wrist injury may temporarily prevent you from being able to use a mouse.

Another example of temporary disibility could include a distracted mother, using her phone using one hand while also taking care of her child. In the moment that she is using the website, she is unable to give full attention to the page. The improved readibility, ease of interaction, and other work dedicated to Accessibility features will benefit her as she navigates the website in the moment.
